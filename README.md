# Microsoft Windows Defender and Firewall Lab

## Objective
The Windows Defender and Firewall Lab sought to create a structured framework for evaluating and enhancing cybersecurity measures within a Windows environment. The primary objective was to conduct comprehensive scans and configure firewall rules to bolster defense mechanisms against potential threats. Through this hands-on exploration, the project aimed to foster a deeper comprehension of security configurations, threat detection capabilities, and proactive measures to safeguard systems against cyber intrusions.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in configuring Microsoft Windows Defender and Firewall settings.
- Ability to conduct comprehensive scans for identifying potential vulnerabilities.
- Skill in creating and implementing effective firewall rules to fortify network security.
- Enhanced understanding of cybersecurity best practices within a Windows environment.
- Development of analytical skills for evaluating and mitigating security threats.

### Tools Used

- Microsoft Windows Defender Antivirus for comprehensive threat detection and mitigation.
- Microsoft Windows Defender Firewall for network traffic management and security configuration.

## Steps
